# Greg Riss's Portfolio

## Descrition

For this project, I built and deployed a responsive portfolio to showcase my Web Development projects and tell vistors a bit about myself. 

The project is deployed here: https://gregriss.github.io

The code can be viewed here: https://github.com/gregriss/gregriss.github.io.git

## Usage

This website should be simple and clear to use, due to Bootstrap's fancy navbar presets.

Here's a screenshot of the Homepage:

## Credits

I referenced Bootstrap's documentation for this project, which can be found at:
https://getboostrap.com/docs

I also referenced https://w3schools.com for HTML and CSS documentation.

Finally, I referenced an article by Sara Cope at https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/ for box shadow documentation.
